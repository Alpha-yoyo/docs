Deathray wont boot using the server kernel but will work fine with the generic kernel. The quickest way around this is to use this iso [Ubuntu-8.04-server-generic](http://www.redbrick.dcu.ie/~sonic/iso/ubuntu-8.04.2-server-i386.iso) as it installs itself with generic instead of server. -sonic\\

Deathray boots fine with the Ubuntu 9.04 server kernel so will probably boot fine with the next Ubuntu-LTS next year. -sonic
