# Cynic RSC Access
Cynic has an RSC, Similar to Murphy, but more basic (read: more shit)

ssh to `sprout.redbrick.dcu.ie`

```
telnet 192.168.1.23
```

Username and password in `pwsafe`

See http://docs.sun.com for help (they're all in PDF format. Thank you sun for
being awkward.), or just type help. It has fuck all commands anyway. Mostly
you'll just want to poweroff/poweron from it.

The console on the RSC seems permanently broken. You'll have to use the
[serial](sprout-serial) connection to get a console.
